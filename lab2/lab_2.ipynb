            "Jak widać, klasa pozytywna jest w znacznej mniejszości, stanowi poniżej 5% zbioru. Taki problem nazywamy **klasyfikacją niezbalansowaną (imbalanced classification)**. Mamy tu **klasę dominującą (majority class)** oraz **klasę mniejszościową (minority class)**. Pechowo prawie zawsze interesuje nas ta druga, bo klasa większościowa jest trywialna. Przykładowo, 99% badanych jest zdrowych, a 1% ma niewykryty nowotwór - z oczywistych przyczyn chcemy wykrywać właśnie sytuację rzadką (problem diagnozy jako klasyfikacji jest zasadniczo zawsze niezbalansowany). W dalszej części laboratorium poznamy szereg konsekwencji tego zjawiska i metody na radzenie sobie z nim.\n",

            "Mamy sporo cech, wszystkie numeryczne. Ciekawe, czy mają wartości brakujące, a jeśli tak, to ile. Policzymy to z pomocą biblioteki Pandas i metody `.isna()`. Domyślnie operuje ona na kolumnach, jak większość metod w Pandasie. Sumę wartości per kolumna zwróci nam metoda `.sum()`. Jeżeli podzielimy to przez liczbę wierszy `len(X)`, to otrzymamy ułamek wartości brakujących w każdej kolumnie.\n",

Zaobserwowano, że pomimo losowania próbek boostrapowych, w baggingu poszczególne drzewa są do siebie bardzo podobne (są skorelowane), używają podobnych cech ze zbioru. My natomiast chcemy zróżnicowania, żeby mieć niski bias - redukcją wariancji zajmuje się uśrednianie. Dlatego używa się metody losowej podprzestrzeni (random subspace method) - przy każdym podziale drzewa losuje się tylko pewien podzbiór cech, których możemy użyć do tego podziału. Typowo jest to pierwiastek kwadratowy z ogólnej liczby cech.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zarówno bagging, jak i lasy losowe mają dodatkowo bardzo przyjemną własność - są mało czułe na hiperparametry, szczególnie na liczbę drzew. W praktyce wystarczy ustawić 500 czy 1000 drzew i będzie dobrze działać. Dalsze dostrajanie hiperparametrów może jeszcze trochę poprawić wyniki, ale nie tak bardzo, jak przy innych klasyfikatorach. Jest to zatem doskonały wybór domyślny, kiedy nie wiemy, jakiego klasyfikatora użyć.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dodatkowo jest to problem **embarassingly parallel** - drzewa można trenować w 100% równolegle, dzięki czemu jest to dodatkowo wydajna obliczeniowo metoda.\n",

            "Drugą bardzo ważną grupą algorytmów ensemblingu jest **boosting**, też oparty o drzewa decyzyjne. O ile Random Forest trenował wszystkie klasyfikatory bazowe równolegle i je uśredniał, o tyle boosting robi to sekwencyjnie. Drzewa te uczą się na całym zbiorze, nie na próbkach boostrapowych. Idea jest następująca: trenujemy drzewo decyzyjne, radzi sobie przeciętnie i popełnia błędy na częsci przykładów treningowych. Dokładamy kolejne, ale znające błędy swojego poprzednika, dzięki czemu może to uwzględnić i je poprawić. W związku z tym \"boostuje\" się dzięki wiedzy od poprzednika. Dokładamy kolejne drzewa zgodnie z tą samą zasadą.\n",

Zakłada się jakąś jej konkretną postać, np. squared error dla regresji, albo logistic loss dla klasyfikacji. Później wykorzystuje się spadek wzdłuż gradientu (gradient descent), aby nauczyć się, w jakim kierunku powinny optymalizować kolejne drzewa, żeby zminimalizować błędy poprzednika. Jest to konkretnie **gradient boosting**, absolutnie najpopularniejsza forma boostingu, i jeden z najpopularniejszych i osiągających najlepsze wyniki algorytmów ML.\n",

Szczególnie ważne implementacje gradient boostingu to **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** oraz **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**. XGBoost był prawdziwym przełomem w ML, uzyskując doskonałe wyniki i bardzo dobrze się skalując - był wykorzystany w CERNie do wykrywania cząstki Higgsa w zbiorze z pomiarów LHC mającym 10 milionów próbek.

Ta pierwsza próbuje wyjaśnić, czemu ogólnie model działa tak, jak działa. Analizuje strukturę modelu oraz trendy w jego predykcjach, aby podsumować w prostszy sposób jego tok myślenia. Interpretowalność lokalna z kolei dotyczy predykcji dla konkretnych próbek - czemu dla danego przykładu model podejmuje dla niego taką, a nie inną decyzję o klasyfikacji.\n",

Każdy podział w drzewie decyzyjnym wykorzystuje jakąś cechę, i redukuje z pomocą podziału funkcję kosztu (np. entropię) o określoną ilość. Dla drzewa decyzyjnego ważność to sumaryczna redukcja entropii, jaką udało się uzyskać za pomocą danej cechy. Dla lasów losowych i boostingu sumujemy te wartości dla wszystkich drzew. Alternatywnie można też użyć liczby splitów, w jakiej została użyta dana cecha, ale jest to mniej standardowe.\n",

            "- ważność cech można tylko porównywać ze sobą, np. jedna jest 2 razy ważniejsza od drugiej; nie ma ogólnych progów ważności\n",
            "\n",
            "Ze względu na powyższe, ważności cech normalizuje się często do zakresu [0, 1] dla łatwiejszego porównywania.\n"

Traktuje się cechy modelu jak zbiór graczy, podzielonych na dwie drużyny (koalicje): jedna chce zaklasyfikować próbkę jako negatywną, a druga jako pozytywną. O ostatecznej decyzji decyduje model, który wykorzystuje te wartości cech. Powstaje pytanie - w jakim stopniu wartości cech przyczyniły się do wyniku swojej drużyny? Można to obliczyć jako wartości Shapleya (Shapley values), które dla modeli ML oblicza algorytm SHAP. Ma on bardzo znaczące, udowodnione matematycznie zalety, a dodatkowo posiada wyjątkowo efektywną implementację dla modeli drzewiastych oraz dobre wizualizacje.\n",
